  <h1>Maths blog</h1>
  <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my epic maths (yes, I prefer the british spelling) blog, which is also one of my first
    attempts at a website. In this blog, I would like to express my passion with maths and share the reasons I like it
    so much.<a href="/maths_topics/cgt.html">Combinatorial game theory</a></p>
