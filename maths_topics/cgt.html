  <h1>Combinatorial game theory</h1>
  <p>Combinatorial game theory is the study of combinatorial games, which are games which conform to the following conditions:<br>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Two players</b> The game must be played with exactly two players.</li>
    <li><b>Turnbased</b> The two players alternatingly take turns.</li>
    <li><b>Complete knowledge</b> There is no hidden information for either player.</li>
    <li><b>Not based on chance</b> Everything that happens in the game must not be based on chance.</li>
    <li><b>Finite</b> The game must, if played well, always end.</li>
    <li><b>No Draws</b> There must always be exactly one winner.</li>
  </ol></p>
  <h2>Let's get started!</h2>
  <p>To begin, we'll look at a very simple (not even deceptively) game, in fact, some might argue it is not a game at all. Both players have some amount of coins, potentially the same amount. On a turn, a player discards any positive number of their coins and when a player can't move anymore, they lose. Say Pepijn and Wout play this game with six and nine coins respectively. It is obvious that Wout has an advantage, since even if Pepijn prolongs his inevitable demise by taking one coin per turn, Wout will always be able to win, no matter who starts, by also only taking one coin per turn. In a similar way the player with the most coins wins.</p>
