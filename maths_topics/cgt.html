  <h1>Combinatorial game theory</h1>
  <p>Combinatorial game theory is the study of combinatorial games, which are games which conform to the following conditions:<br>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Two players</b> The game must be played with exactly two players.</li>
    <li><b>Turnbased</b> The two players alternatingly take turns.</li>
    <li><b>Complete knowledge</b> There is no hidden information for either player.</li>
    <li><b>Not based on chance</b> Everything that happens in the game must not be based on chance.</li>
    <li><b>Finite</b> The game must, if played well, always end.</li>
    <li><b>No Draws</b> There must always be exactly one winner.</li>
</ol></p>
